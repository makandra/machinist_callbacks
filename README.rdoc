= machinist_callbacks

Some record construction rules cannot be expressed with a {machinist}[http://github.com/notahat/machinist] blueprint, for instance:

* Creating a record with a has_many association already filled in.
* Creating a record with interdependencies between associated object, such as having to belong to the same container.
* Needing to process a {delayed_job}[http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job] queue after record construction.

This gem provides <tt>before_make</tt> and <tt>after_make</tt> callbacks for machinist blueprints,
enabling more freedom in your construction rules.

== Example

    Movie.blueprint do
      title
      year 2001
      before_make do
        self.producer = Producer.make(:name => director.name)
      end
    end

    Director.blueprint do
      name
      after_make do
        movies << Movie.make
      end
    end

== Does it work with make_unsaved?

Yes. Machinist is built in a way that every <tt>make</tt> in your callback implicitely becomes a <tt>make_unsaved</tt>
when an object graph is created with <tt>make_unsaved</tt>.

== Installation

Install the gem:
    sudo gem install machinist_callbacks

Require the gem after requiring machinist in your <tt>environment.rb</tt>:
    config.gem 'machinist'
    config.gem 'machinist_callbacks'
